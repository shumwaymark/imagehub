# Version History and Changelog

All notable changes the **imagehub** project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Ongoing Development

- Improving documentation content, layout, arrangement and flow.
- Developing a "large image buffer" using the new Python 3.8 SharedMemory
  class. The idea: put all newly received images into a very
  large (up to available memory; could be 3GB or more). This would allow
  receiving images into this buffer and then immediately returning the 'OK'
  message back to the sending **imagenode**. Then a separate `multiprocessing`
  process empties the buffer by saving images in a separate process. The
  theoretical advantage over the existing setup (saving images in a separate
  thread) would be that a 2nd process (on a different CPU core) for saving
  images could be much faster than a thread running on the same core. Early
  tests are promising, but the speed versus complexity tradeoffs aren't clear
  yet.
